# Different classes for propositions are useful because this allows for more dynamic constraint creation
# for propositions within that class. For example, you can enforce that "at least one" of the propositions
# that are instances of this class must be true by using a @constraint decorator.
# other options include: at most one, exactly one, at most k, and implies all.
